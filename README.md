# adstxt-results

A library to pull down the latest file from https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/adstxtcrawler/tree/adstxt-results

## Background

Per Bjorke, Product Manager for Ad Traffic Quality at Google, puts out a list of domains which according to Google host Ads.txt files.

He does this by adding a new file each week to a branch of the IAB's adstxtcrawler GitHub repo at https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/adstxtcrawler/tree/adstxt-results.

The files have started to be added with a naming convention which contains the date of the file.

This project is designed to provide a library which will when exercised grab the latest file from this branch.
