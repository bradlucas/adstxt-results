      <h3>Details</h3>
      <p>Per Bjorke, Product Manager for Ad Traffic Quality at Google, puts out a list of domains which according to Google host Ads.txt files. He does this by adding a new file each week to a branch of the IAB's adstxtcrawler GitHub repo at <a target="_default" href="https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/adstxtcrawler/tree/adstxt-results">https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/adstxtcrawler/tree/adstxt-results<a>.</p>
      <p>The files are added with a naming convention which contains the date of the file. This site is the web interface to a library which was designed to look in the `adstxt-results` branch of the repo and extract the most recent file. Also, links a above let you gatyher the data from the file (as a text list or json) or as the original file.</p>
      <p>There are three routes to return data. The first returns the list of domains as a simple text list. The second results in the original file being downloaded and the last returns a json description of the file's contents.</p>
